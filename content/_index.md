#### _Leveraging serverless functions_

**Bento is a blazing-fast serverless video transcoding pipeline** that takes advantage of the instant scale and concurrent execution of function-as-a-service to parallelize 
the video transcoding process.

Videos are pulled into hundreds of small, quick to transcode segments and then stitched back together, resulting in 
lightning fast transcoding jobs.

    <h2>Cantor</h2>

![Cantor icon](/images/Cantor.png)

Cantor is a React Native mobile application that I dreamt up, designed, built and deployed.

Cantor solves the very practical problem (for a select few I suppose) of needing a complete Psalter pointed for plainchant, as well as 
a number of plainchant tones at ones finger tips.
