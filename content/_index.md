#### _Leveraging serverless functions_

**Bento is a blazing-fast serverless video transcoding pipeline** that takes advantage of the instant scale and concurrent execution of function-as-a-service to parallelize 
the video transcoding process.

Videos are pulled into hundreds of small, quick to transcode segments and then stitched back together, resulting in 
lightning fast transcoding jobs.

Cantor is a React Native mobile application that I dreamt up, designed, built and deployed.

Cantor solves the very practical problem (for a select few I suppose) of needing a complete Psalter pointed for plainchant, as well as 
a number of plainchant tones at ones finger tips.
