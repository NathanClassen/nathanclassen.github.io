#### _What can be done with serverless functions?_

#### Bento is a blazing-fast serverless video transcoding pipeline.

Bento takes advantage of the instant scale and concurrent execution of function-as-a-service architecture to parallelize 
the video transcoding process.

Videos are pulled into hundreds of small, quick to transcode segments and then stitched back together, resulting in 
lightning fast transcoding jobs.

We've made it easy for small businesses to deploy Bento to their AWS account and launch the dashboard to upload, 
transcode, and download all of their videos while maintaining control over their content.

# [Cantor](https://cantorpsalms.app/)
![Cantor icon](Cantor.png)

Cantor is a React Native mobile application that I dreamt up, designed, built and deployed.

Cantor solves the very practical problem (for a select few I suppose) of needing a complete Psalter pointed for plainchant, as well as 
a number of plainchant tones at ones finger tips.
