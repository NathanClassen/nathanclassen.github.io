### upgrade time

For some time now my personal website and portfolio had consisted entirely of cumbersome, custom html and css.

From a design and functionality standpoint, there was not much there. The design was neither simple and clean, nor was it dynamic and interesting. A single html page with no real means of adding content.

I would not call myself a _writer_, but I knew I wanted something like a small blog on my website; to collect ideas, share what I am learning, etc.

Well the time has finally come, and I have decided to build a new site with Hugo.

### decision time

A primarily back-end guy by trade, the prospect of creating a new site has been somewhat daunting. This mainly due to the myriad of options.

I knew that I did not want a Wordpress site. I have significant experience with React, but I knew I wanted a more lightweight solution for my site. 

I had heard of 'static sites' and static-site generators but really understood the whole space very little:

> "I get to write a slew of html every time I want new content? Tempting..."

Happily I stumbled upon Hakyll (a Haskell library for building static site generators), and became very intrigued and decided to investigate.

Long story short, I discovered the idea of creating content with Markdown (sweet, sweet md); the speed and security benefits of static sites (_everybody's_ going to be after my portfolio site, I'm sure...) and really discovered ssg's for the first time.

This sounded like the way to go and as my current tech obsession is spelunking into the depths of Golang, I decided on Hugo.

Being that this is my maiden voyage into static-site generators and all the accompanying goodness, I have decided to create a few posts to document the journey.

With this, post #1 in said category draws to a close.

Onward!
