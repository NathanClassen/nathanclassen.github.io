### upgrade time

For some time now my personal website and portfolio has consisted entirely of cumbersome, custom html and css. 
A couple interesting projects notwithstanding, there has not been much to look at on the encrusted page. 
For me, there has been no real means of adding new content either.

Not a few times I have thought that I would _really_ get after it, and rectify the whole situation.

The time has finally come, and I have decided to build a new static site with Hugo!

### decision time

A back-end guy by trade, the prospect of creating a new site has been somewhat daunting. This mainly due to the myriad 
of options and the fact that I am not exactly up on the latest.

I have significant React experience, but I knew I wanted a more lightweight solution for my site. 

I had heard of "static sites" and static-site generators (ssg's) but really understood the whole space very little:

> "I get to write a slew of html every time I want new content? Tempting..."

Very happily I stumbled upon Hakyll (a Haskell library for building static site generators), became very intrigued with
the whole thing again, and decided to investigate.

Long story short, I discovered the idea of creating content with Markdown (sweet, sweet md); the speed and security 
benefits of static sites (_everybody's_ going to be after my portfolio site, I'm sure...) and really discovered ssg's for the first time.

As my current tech obsession is spelunking into the depths of Golang, I decided on Hugo.

Being that this is my maiden voyage into static-site generators and all the accompanying goodness, I have created a separate
category of posts to document the campaign.

With this, post #1 in said category draws to a close.

Onward!
