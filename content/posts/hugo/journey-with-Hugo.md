### upgrade time

For some time my personal website consisted entirely of cumbersome, custom html and css.

From a design and functionality standpoint, there was not much there. The design was neither simple and clean, nor dynamic and interesting. It was a single  html page, not overly pleasing to look at, with no real means of adding content.

Every visit to my page spawned new ideas for what I eventually wanted it to be. It was to look much more clean and simple. No slight gradient backgrounds. Away with the screen-shots of past projects. I also wanted to add something like a small blog to collect ideas, share whatever I was learning, etc.

Slowly the plan came together, awaiting execution and I am glad to write that the time has finally come, and I have decided to build a new site with Hugo.

### decision time

I knew that I did not want a Wordpress site. I have significant experience with React, but I also wanted a more lightweight solution for my site. 

I had heard of 'static sites' and static-site generators but really understood the whole space very little:

> "I get to write a slew of html every time I want new content? Tempting..."

Happily I stumbled upon Hakyll (a Haskell library for building static site generators), and became very intrigued and decided to investigate what exactly static-sites are, and where a static site generator comes in.

Long story short, I discovered the idea of creating content with Markdown (sweet, sweet md); the speed and security benefits of static sites (_everybody's_ going to be after my blog, I'm sure...) and really discovered ssg's for the first time.

This sounded like the way to go and as my current tech obsession is spelunking into the depths of Golang, I decided on Hugo.

Being that this is my maiden voyage into static-site generators and all the accompanying goodness, I have decided to create a few posts to document the journey.

With this, post #1 in said category draws to a close.

Onward!
