If by any means I could be convinced that it would benefit my life that I should go mad by reading books of chivalry and knight-errantry—fixating my mind entirely upon that subject—until at last I was entirely persuaded that I was in fact a lofty knight; such that I went galavanting about town questing and adventuring, it would be by means of reading a singular and obscure line in Don Quixote:

> “and in the same proportion that Sancho was disgusted at not being able to reach some village, his master was rejoiced at an opportunity of sleeping under the cope of heaven, because he looked upon every occasion of this kind as an act of possession, that strengthened the proof of his knight-errantry”

Yes. That might do it.

## the man

Don Quixote De La Mancha—or was it something like Quixana—is a man who down to his bones understands who he is. Or at least has completely laid hold of an idea about who he is. In reality he is a man not altogether right in the head who for better or worse has come to believe that he is a noble lord; a protector and a servant of righteousness; a knight.

As Quixana, the unknown country gentleman, he is so taken with the glory and adventure of knights tales, that he consumes such books with fevered voraciousness, and thereby convinces himself that he is in fact a chivalrous knight and must, for the good of all, undertake his own quest. Renaming and re-fashioning himself into Don Quixote, and his near-perishing emaciated horse into Rocinante, he sets off to do exploits.

The story is a comedy and the humor is found in watching a man who lacks the substance of a true knight nevertheless engage with and react to the world as though he were a knight of the highest order. To see bravado befitting a knight come from the mouth of the likes of Quixote makes for hilarious reading. Observe one of my favorite quips, and one that shall become my regular retort to any slights made against my facial hair... 

His niece wants to suggest that it may be prudent for him to lead a quiet life at home rather than taking the risk of _"going out for wool"_ only to _"come home quite shorn"_

> My dear niece, replied Don Quixote, you are altogether out of your reckoning. Before I be shorn, I will pull and pluck off the beards of all those who pretend to touch a single hair of my mustache.

Inumerable are to occasions wherein the reader gets a good laugh at or with the Don.

Yet I have not been able to stave off a certain admiration for the fellow. I don't admire him in the way one might admire a child who has become caught up in vigorous and skilled make-believe. I admire how he lives so thoroughly and consistently with his own character. Made up or no.

At the start I expected to discover our gallant and intrepid man reduced to a discourteous and limp fellow whenever expediancy demanded it.

What I have found is that the idea of _giving up the act_ for the sake of expediancy does not seem to be a category for him. There is no sense that he has in mind some grand end for his made-up knighthood. No sense at all that he will put on the knight and remove him again when it is convenient or enjoyable to be one or the other; a sensible land-owner, or a chivalrous knight.

One may puff at that, "being a knight does not sound like such a rough lot. Why should it ever be _convenient_ for him to cease being the hero of legends?"

That is understandable. Knights are knighted by the Queen. The feast on pheasant and only deign themselves to speak courage into the hearts of adoring young boys. Yet the call is not without common place down-to-earthedness. Even for a knight there is bureaurcracy—that enemy of the hearts of men—which at the first rearing of the head is enough to make a man cut corners. But consider the following:

> but, scare was he clear of the village, when he was assaulted by such a terrible objection, as had well nigh induced our hero to abandon his enterprise directly: for, he recollected that he had never been knighted; and therefore, according to the laws of chivalry, he neither could nor ought to enter the lists with any antagonist of that degree

Quixote, setting off on his first journey suddenly comes to the terrible realization that he has not been properly knighted. All true and great knights must thus be ordained and, to his dismay, comes the recollection that he has not been. Now, if the business of being a knight were a mere means to an end for master Quixote, it would have been just as well to forget the whole issue of ordination. He could have plugged in the GameShark; entered the cheat codes. Or to leave the archaic he could have  modded the game. Plainly put, he could have chuckled and gone on his merry way, "this is not the glorious part of my scheme, I shall leave it out."

It is not so with Quixote. This issue of his ordination actually causes him no small amount on consternation, and he immediately resolves to make good and to follow the proper channels. He will seek ordination as swiftly as possible.

The fact that his delusions allow him to be ordained by an inn-keeper and two, ehm, _women of the game_, in no way discredites his sincerity. He has not broken character as evidenced by his rejection of cheap glory:

> ... even granting he had received that mark of distinction, it was his duty to wear white armour, like a new knight, without any device in his shield, until such time as his valour should entitle him to that honor.

He rejects half-measures all the way down. So it is not a matter of expediancy or non-expediancy. Quixote is a knight as an end, not a means. Or rather, it is as a knight that he pursues ends with means. Indeed, The Knight is what determines what the ends shall be and what means are appropriate in the pursuit.

Quixote knows what character he is and I have not yet seen him shrug this character off. It is this character and this _being the character_ in truth, which causes Quixote to live fully and to resond well to the pinches and pricks, and in his case the occasional body-slam, that so often and easily, leave the sane people weary and embittered.

Don Quixote is a knight-errant. Or at least he has completely laid hold of the idea that he is a knight-errant. He has imbibed and subsequently embodied the character of a knight entirely.

What is a knight like? The Don would be more affiliated with the question than I, but I will do my best.

A knight is noble. He carries his head high above base habits and passions; high above trivial pursuits, dull gossip, and the like. His aims are for good and glory, and these are his trophies. Persevering under pressure and duty, accepting with hearty cheer all responsibility laid at his feet. A knight possesses kindness and utterly rejects niceness. He is a friend to all the downcast but no sucker. One need not feel obliged to tip-toe around such a noble character for fear of malicious wrath, but do not cross a knight unless you seek a wound.

If that is _The Knight_ Don Quixote knows all of it and much more. He knows The Knight intimately for, after all, he is one and as I say, he is genuine and constant in the calling.

It is this knowledge and spirit which informs not only the things Quixote does but how he responds to every situation and indeed, how he sees the world.

## the misfortunes peculiar to knights-errant

In his travels, our knight naturally encounters many dangers, trials, terrible foes, companions, mysteries, and so on. In the material world, however, these things are really so many inconveniences, blunders and annoyances.

During his first ride from home, Quixote comes upon a band of merchants. Perceiving them to be scoundrels, Quixote takes it upon himself to demand a confession from the travelers, that his lady Dulcinea del Toboso is the most glorious woman in the universe. When they refuse his demand, he makes toward them to punish their "licentious blasphemy". Luckily for everyone, his horse stumbles and throws its rider headlong to the ground, rendering him unable to pursue the blasphemers. His own lance is broken in two by one of the mule drivers, and he receives a beating upon the ribs with it.

The man naturally encounters many beatings, meddlers, and failures. We have already mentioned _beauracary_... Yet he does not grumble and faint. Why? Because in reality, these are so many dangers, trials, enemies, companions, mysteries and so on. The laws of chivalry--as we have seen. He embraces his lot and all of the attendant obstacles as wholly befitting such a one as himself.

Surely this is an unfortunate situation that would upset the best of us. A man sets out to do something good (in his mind anyway) and his good efforts and intentions are thwarted by forces outside of his control. This is a painful and annoying defeat for Quixote. Quite an inconvenience, and yet he is not the least discouraged or downcast. He does not mope about in frustration but pursues. The story goes on:

>  ... the Don, who, notwithstanding this storm of blows which descended on him, never shut his mouth, but continued threatening heaven and earth, and those brigands, for such he took the merchants to be.

Surely this is an occasion for moping. This is the time to let out a manly roar of self-pity. When your plans have been thwarted; when your sterile and wonderful plans for the day have been dashed against some annoyance, now is the hour of sulking come.

Don Quixote may be pursuing the scoundrels with his tongue, but is his heart setting up the furniture for the pity party? Nay.

> He did not, however, look upon himself as unhappy, because this misfortune was, in his opinion, peculiar to knights-errant ...

This is just the kind of setback a knight should expect. And therein lies the compulsion to bear up under trial.

A misfortune encountered by a shapeless, formless, someone is a misfortune. When it is encountered by Don Quixote, it is a misfortune peculiar to knight, and is therefore to be met in a way meet for a knight. With gusto; forbearance; manly persevearance. It is part of the adventure.

> “An adventure is only an inconvenience rightly considered. An inconvenience is only an adventure wrongly considered.” ― G.K. Chesterton.

If my suspicions had been correct, and Quixana was a man simply masquerading as a knight for some end be it fame, vain-glory or wealth or whatever, this event and plenty others ought to perturb and derail him; but he is not after some other end. He is a knight and he glories in that as the prize itself. These would be potholes in the road to some prize are part and parcel of the prize. Integral to who he is and so to be relished.

> and in the same proportion that Sancho was disgusted at not being able to reach some village, his master was rejoiced at an opportunity of sleeping under the cope of heaven, because he looked upon every occasion of this kind as an act of possession, that strengthened the proof of his knight-errantry.

### Sancho is no knight

At this point let me clarify one thing. I am not a knight nor the son of a knight. I do not have aspirations to wonder about seeking to rectify squabbles and conquer cities. That kind of thing is frowned upon these days.

Sancho Panźa is not a knight either.

Sancho is <description of him> . Sancho leaves his wife and children to follow Don Quixote on his journey.

What motivates Sancho is the prospect of governing an island

> the  quote where quixote promises him an island

Interestingly (to me anyway) he brings this promise to remembrance in the very same chapter that my quote above is from. It is after a fairly trivial skirmish ...

Sancho is a man driven wholly by his desire for reward. He is a goal-oriented fellow.

Better that he were inspired to action by who he is; by being a character than inspiration of bare desire.

My argument is not that Sancho or I should aspire to be knights. Rather, that our lives would be fuller and we would understand ourselves and others and the world better if we were to _be_ the characters we are. I believe that Don Quixote receives life so well because he has completely laid hold of the idea that who he is, his character, is a knight-errant.

## meaningless drive

Why is this desirable? Why would the quote at the beginning of the aritcle be compelling?

Consider who would not prefer cope of heaven to inside a goat shack or, “listen to the sweet cries of my generations” to “I wish my kid would shut up”

The difference between Sancho and his master, is that the one

don q, who is he ->
he is a man who thinks he is a knight; funny ->
intro to my thesis

his being a knight affects his responses ->



not to say be knights, but to say be your character ->
contrasting possible responses

being a character gets at the truth better than seeking ends merely














Bares up under duty; exalts more passionately in the good; meets challenges with utter commitment

What’s the difference between the two?

Relates below

Why does he? How does he?
    He knows his character. He knows who he is, and he is noble.

We don’t know ourselves

It’s hard to know ourselves

Materialism wars against this kind of self. There is no identity. Only chemical. Think Dr Frost in That Hiddeous Strength.

Are we sane?



One of the earliest and most constant examples would be Quioxtes horse: Roccinante.

Roccinante is the exalted name he gives to his horse. The horse, "had cracked hoofs and was as gaunt as Gonela's, that _tantum pellis et ossa fuit_". The essence of this character is an emaciated, near dead horse. But to Quixote, noble knight that he is, the horse "appeared infinitely preferable to Alexander's Bucephalus, or the Cid's Babieca". In short this is 

Quixote is not troubled by the severe poverty that is his means of transportation. He embraces the shambling creature as the greatest steed ever to clop upon terra firma.
