<p>For some time my personal website consisted entirely of cumbersome, custom html and css.</p>
<p>From a design and functionality standpoint, there was not much there. The design was neither simple and clean, nor dynamic and interesting. It was a single html page, not overly pleasing to look at, with no real means of adding content.</p>
<p>Every visit to my page spawned new ideas for what I eventually wanted it to be. It was to look much more clean and simple. No slight gradient backgrounds. Away with the screen-shots of past projects. I also wanted to add something like a small blog to collect ideas, share whatever I was learning, etc.</p>
<p>Slowly the plan came together, awaiting execution and I am glad to write that the time has finally come, and I have decided to build a new site with Hugo.</p>
<h3 id=decision-time>decision time</h3>
<p>I knew that I did not want a Wordpress site. I have significant experience with React, but I also wanted a more lightweight solution for my site.</p>
<p>I had heard of &lsquo;static sites&rsquo; and static-site generators but really understood the whole space very little:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I get to write a slew of html every time I want new content? Tempting&mldr;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Happily I stumbled upon Hakyll (a Haskell library for building static site generators), and was very intrigued. I decided to investigate what exactly static-sites are, and where a static site generator comes in.</p>
<p>Long story short, I discovered the idea of creating content with Markdown (sweet, sweet md); the speed and security benefits of static sites (<em>everybody&rsquo;s</em> going to be after my blog, I&rsquo;m sure&mldr;) and really discovered ssg&rsquo;s for the first time.</p>
<p>This sounded like the way to go and as my current tech obsession is spelunking into the depths of Golang, I decided on Hugo.</p>
<p>Being that this is my maiden voyage into static-site generators and all the accompanying goodness, I have decided to create a few posts to document the journey.</p>
<p>With this, post #1 in said category draws to a close.</p>
<p>Onward!</p>
