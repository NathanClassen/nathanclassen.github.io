<p>For some time now my personal website and portfolio had consisted entirely of cumbersome, custom html and css.</p>
<p>From a design and functionality standpoint, there was not much there. The design was neither simple and clean, nor was it dynamic and interesting. A single html page with no real means of adding content.</p>
<p>I would not call myself a <em>writer</em>, but I knew I wanted something like a small blog on my website; to collect ideas, share what I am learning, etc.</p>
<p>Well the time has finally come, and I have decided to build a new site with Hugo.</p>
<h3 id=decision-time>decision time</h3>
<p>A primarily back-end guy by trade, the prospect of creating a new site has been somewhat daunting. This mainly due to the myriad of options.</p>

<p>I knew that I did not want a Wordpress site. I have significant experience with React, but I knew I wanted a more lightweight solution for my site.</p>
<p>I had heard of &lsquo;static sites&rsquo; and static-site generators but really understood the whole space very little:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I get to write a slew of html every time I want new content? Tempting&mldr;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Happily I stumbled upon Hakyll (a Haskell library for building static site generators), and became very intrigued and decided to investigate.</p>
<p>Long story short, I discovered the idea of creating content with Markdown (sweet, sweet md); the speed and security benefits of static sites (<em>everybody&rsquo;s</em> going to be after my portfolio site, I&rsquo;m sure&mldr;) and really discovered ssg&rsquo;s for the first time.</p>
<p>This sounded like the way to go and as my current tech obsession is spelunking into the depths of Golang, I decided on Hugo.</p>
<p>Being that this is my maiden voyage into static-site generators and all the accompanying goodness, I have decided to create a few posts to document the journey.</p>
<p>With this, post #1 in said category draws to a close.</p>
<p>Onward!</p>
