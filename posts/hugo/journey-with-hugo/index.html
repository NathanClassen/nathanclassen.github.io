<h3 id=upgrade-time>upgrade time</h3>
<p>For some time now my personal website and portfolio has consisted entirely of cumbersome, custom html and css.
A couple interesting projects notwithstanding, there has not been much to look at on the encrusted page.
For me, there has been no real means of adding new content either.</p>
<p>Not a few times I have thought that I would <em>really</em> get after it, and rectify the whole situation.</p>
<p>The time has finally come, and I have decided to build a new static site with Hugo!</p>
<h3 id=decision-time>decision time</h3>
<p>A back-end guy by trade, the prospect of creating a new site has been somewhat daunting. This mainly due to the myriad
of options and the fact that I am not exactly up on the latest.</p>
<p>I have significant React experience, but I knew I wanted a more lightweight solution for my site.</p>
<p>I had heard of &ldquo;static sites&rdquo; and static-site generators (ssg&rsquo;s) but really understood the whole space very little:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I get to write a slew of html every time I want new content? Tempting&mldr;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very happily I stumbled upon Hakyll (a Haskell library for building static site generators), became very intrigued with
the whole thing again, and decided to investigate.</p>
<p>Long story short, I discovered the idea of creating content with Markdown (sweet, sweet md); the speed and security
benefits of static sites (<em>everybody&rsquo;s</em> going to be after my portfolio site, I&rsquo;m sure&mldr;) and really discovered ssg&rsquo;s for the first time.</p>
<p>As my current tech obsession is spelunking into the depths of Golang, I decided on Hugo.</p>
<p>Being that this is my maiden voyage into static-site generators and all the accompanying goodness, I have created a separate
category of posts to document the campaign.</p>
<p>With this, post #1 in said category draws to a close.</p>
<p>Onward!</p>
