So writing the tool in question can really be accomplished in a matter of seconds (depending on how quickly one can type I suppose), and then all that&rsquo;s left is to set it up for use anywhere on ones machine.</p><p>This post documents the very basic process that I use to create such classes of programs, all from the terminal.</p><h2 id=write-the-program>write the program</h2><p>Create a file and give it the same name you would like to invoke in order to use it. Below is my code for a command which opens a file or project with IntelliJ Community Edition:</p><h4 id=create-the-file>create the file:</h4><ul><li><code>$ touch tellj</code></li></ul><h4 id=write-the-script>write the script:</h4><p><code>nano</code> into <code>tellj</code> and:</p><ul><li><code>#!/bin/bash</code></li><li><code># open file with IntelliJ IDE</code></li><li><code>open -a IntelliJ\ IDEA\ CE.app $1</code></li></ul><h2 id=set-permissions>set permissions</h2><p>Next set the proper permissions on the file to allow it to be executed:</p><ul><li><code>$ chmod 755 tellj</code> will allow the file owner to read, modify, and execute the file as a command; all users may read and execute the file as a command</li><li><code>$ chmod 555 tellj</code> will allow all users to read and execute the command, but none may change it</li></ul><h2 id=put-it-in-the-path>put it in the PATH</h2><p>The <code>tellj</code> file is now an executable file, and may be used by referencing the file itself:</p><p><code>./tellj some_file</code></p><p>Currently, one would have to a complete relative path to the <code>tellj</code> file in order to execute it. A complete path would also have to be used to pass in the argument for the file to be opened.</p><p>The <code>tellj</code> command should be executable from whatever location in the file system. Therefore, the executable <code>tellj</code> file should be moved into a location which falls in the PATH:</p><p><code>$ mv tellj some/location/in/PATH</code></p><h2 id=execute>execute</h2><p><code>$ tellj my/project</code></p><br>The end.</div></html>
