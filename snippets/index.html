I am your enemy, and as an enemy I would have slain you; I can die as resolutely as I could kill: both to do and to endure valiantly is the Roman way. Nor am I the only one to carry this resolution against you: behind me is a long line of men who are seeking the same honour. Gird yourself therefore, if you think it worth your while, for a struggle in which you must fight for your life from hour to hour with an armed foe always at your door. Such is the war we, the Roman youths, declare on you. Fear no serried ranks, no battle; it will be between yourself alone and a single enemy at a time.” The king, at once hot with resentment and aghast at his danger, angrily ordered the prisoner to be flung into the flames unless he should at once divulge the plot with which he so obscurely threatened him.

Before I be shorn, I will pull and pluck off the beards of all those who pretend to touch a single hair of my mustache.&rdquo;</p><ul><li>&ndash; Don Quixote, Miguel de Cervantes</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you desire to be an eccentric and a thinker, a 3/4 turn headshot&ndash;both hands front and center frozen in a grasping gesture&ndash;is of the utmost importance.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The more I love humanity in general the less I love man in particular.</p><ul><li>&ndash; The Brothers Karamazov, Fyodor Dostoevsky</li></ul></blockquote></div></html>
