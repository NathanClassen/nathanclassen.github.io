Before I be shorn, I will pull and pluck off the beards of all those who pretend to touch a single hair of my mustache.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Two</title><link>http://nathanclassen.github.io/snippets/2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 17:22:40 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://nathanclassen.github.io/snippets/2/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
